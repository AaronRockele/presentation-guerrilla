# Presentation: Il gusto pizza

## How much do i charge for this website

  Around 100â‚¬ 

## The problems of the current website.

+ It had a weird header
+ The background is too overwhelming
+ They gave an opacity to the texts sections. 

## How did i improve on this?

+ I made a basic background. (red and not to overwhelming)
+ I tried to get the same layout. just more readable.
+ I made the slideshow full width so the ugly header is not needed.
