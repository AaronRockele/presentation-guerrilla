## how much do i charge for this website

  around 100â‚¬ 

## the problems of the current website.

+ it had a weird header
+ the background is too overwhelming
+ they gave an opacity to the texts sections. 

## how did i improve on this?

+ i made a basic background. (red and not to overwhelming)
+ i tried to get the same layout. just more readable.
+ i made the slideshow full width so the ugly header is not needed.
